## Fixes

- Profit calculation for gathering recipes that increase reagent quality
- Invalidate caches when prices change (e.g. after an AH scan)
- Disable scanning/sorting without price source
- Handle finishing reagents that change resourcefulness/multicraft yield

## Features

- Cost breakdown by reagent in the tooltip
- Show profit per resourcefulness/multicraft/ingenuity point
- Include ingenuity in profit/concentration calculation
- Update concentration cost in experimentation mode and on unclaimed orders
- Allow enabling concentration with insufficient currency in experimentation mode
- Set amount when buying missing tracked reagents in the AH
- Set crafting queue amount for tracked recipes

## Maybe

- Profession gear optimization
- Reagent costs override
